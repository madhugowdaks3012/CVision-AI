### Semantic Resume Screening System (Fully Offline AI)

CVision AI is an AI-powered Resume Screening System that uses Transformer-based sentence embeddings to measure semantic similarity between resumes and job descriptions.

Unlike traditional keyword-based systems, this application understands contextual meaning using deep NLP models.

## 📌 Key Features

✔ Fully Offline AI Model (No API Required)  
✔ Transformer-Based Semantic Matching  
✔ Resume Chunk-Level Analysis for Better Accuracy  
✔ Interactive Streamlit UI  
✔ Match Percentage Score with Smart Feedback  
✔ Clean, Professional Architecture

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Extracts text from uploaded PDF resume  
2. Splits resume into meaningful text chunks  
3. Converts resume and job description into vector embeddings  
4. Computes cosine similarity  
5. Returns the average of top matching segments  
6. Displays candidate fit score with feedback  

This improves accuracy compared to simple TF-IDF keyword matching.
